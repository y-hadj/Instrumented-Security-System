## Introduction
This repository presents an updraged Instrumented Security System designed for use in a real cement factory. It is based on an old and upractical system. It highlights its drawbacks and upgrades them to a stronger prevention and protection layers.
The base system is derived from a end-of-studies project and the upgraded system aims to enhance security and monitoring within the factory premises.

## Project Description
The project includes the following components:

- **PDF Report:** A comprehensive report detailing the entire project. You can access the report [here](./ISS_report.pdf).

- **ZelioSoft Simulation:** A simulation file for the designed security system. You can download the simulation file [here](./Protection_Layer.zm2).

- **Demonstrative Video:** A video demonstrating the simulation of the protection layer of the designed security system. You can watch the video [here](./demo_video.mp4).
